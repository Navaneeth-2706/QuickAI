#AI SaaS Platform (PERN Stack)
**Overview**
A full-stack AI-powered SaaS application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js).
The platform provides AI-driven text and image features, focusing on backend integration, API design, and system architecture.

**Key Features**
* Resume and content generation using AI
* Blog title and long-form text generation
* Image generation, background removal, and object removal
* RESTful APIs with authentication
* Relational data modeling using PostgreSQL

**Tech Stack**
* Frontend: React
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js
* Database: PostgreSQL
* AI Services: Hugging Face (text-based AI features),ClipDrop API (image generation, background removal, object removal)

**Design Notes**
* Uses external AI APIs to demonstrate API integration and backend orchestration rather than training models from scratch.
* Not deployed due to higher inference latency on free-tier AI services.
* Focused on clean backend logic, REST API design, and system integration.

**What This Project Demonstrates**
* Full-stack web development
* Secure API integration
* Database design and backend workflows
* Engineering trade-off awareness in AI systems
